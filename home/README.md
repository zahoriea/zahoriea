# New Tab experiment

### Why does this exist?
New Tab experiment was born out of a need to reclaim attention while surfing the web. Have you ever been researching a topic or doing work, only to open up a new tab in Chrome and become distracted by screenshots of the top sites you waste time on? We have. This experiment is an attempt to reclaim the New Tab space, and in so doing, to assert more control when jumping between tasks while web browsing.

### What can you use the New Tab space for?

We often use the New Tab as a persistent to-do list, writing the mosts important tasks of the day. You could also use the space for affirmations, quotes, jokes, etc. The space is yours to use however you would like.

### How to Use

1. Install [New Tab Redirect](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/new-tab-redirect/icpgjfneehieebagbmdbhnlpiopdcmna?hl=en) for [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/index.html).

2. In [New Tab Redirect](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/new-tab-redirect/icpgjfneehieebagbmdbhnlpiopdcmna?hl=en)'s Options page, point the **Redirect URL** to [izziezahorian.com/home](http://izziezahorian.com/home).

3. Want to customize your new tab URL? Simply upload these files to whatever domain or subdomain you would like, then follow the instructions above.

You're done!

Now, every time you open a new tab in Google Chrome, you will automatically be directed to [izziezahorian.com/home](http://izziezahorian.com/home) or your custom URL. Edit your new tab with whatever text you would like. It will save automatically and reappear whenever you open up a new tab.

No longer want your New Tab to redirect to [izziezahorian.com/home](http://izziezahorian.com/home)? Simply uninstall the [New Tab Redirect](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/new-tab-redirect/icpgjfneehieebagbmdbhnlpiopdcmna?hl=en) extension to restore default settings.
